                <h3>About e-Logbook</h3>
                <p>e-Logbook is a departure from the traditional way of IT reporting by bringing/closing the gap between the students and their supervisors. 
                    Many IT students ususally needed more attention than is given to them during their industrial training resulting in lukewarm attitude
                    on the part of students and a defeat on the aim of the IT in general. This problem may be correted by looking for a medium of continuous interaction 
                    between the supervisor and his/her students.
